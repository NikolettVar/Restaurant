Higher Diploma in Computing, Software Development, Web Design and Client Side Scripting module.
This project was developed in a group of 3 as an end-of-semester exam.
The project's main requirement was to develop a website for a business of our choice, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I developed the top Navigation Bar, the Footer, the Home and About Us pages.
I used HTML, CSS (including advanced CSS techniques, such as  Flexbox and Media Queries) and JavaScript, while the rest of the pages were created by the 2 other students in the group.
